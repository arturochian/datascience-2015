## Lab: SMS Spam Detection Classifier
### Objective: Create a Naive Bayes Classifier that accurately classifies SMSs as spam vs ham
Create a new repo called `supervised-learning-algos`. Within this repo, add a top-level README of something to the effect of:
```
In this repository, I demonstrate mastery of the most common supervised learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighors
- Support Vector Machines
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Random Forests
- Decision Trees

```
Then create a directory under `supervised-learning-algos` called `naive-bayes`.
Under `naive-bayes` create a README.md with the description of this SMS spam detection problem and the link below to the data source so that folks looking at your GitHub will be able to verify how awesome you are.

- Data source: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ga-dat-2015-suneel/datasets/sms_spam_or_ham.csv
- Warning: **Do not open in excel!** - this will mess up the encoding and you'll have to delete the file and re-download it.
- Description of data: each row is of the form "label, body" where label is either spam or ham (not spam) and body is the SMS body.
- Description of challenge: Using code similar to what we did for Twitter sentiment analysis, create a classifier and experiment with the feature set to most accurately predict whether an SMS is spam or ham.

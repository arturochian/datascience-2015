# Numpy Practice

0. Use `arange` to create an array of the numbers from 0 to 100.
1. Create two arrays [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6] and add them.
2. Create a 3-by-6 matrix and then find out its dimensionality using `ndim`.
3. In the aforementioned matrix, use `dtype` to discover the data types within the matrix.
4. Create a 4-by-5 matrix full of zeros using `zeros`. Then, create a 5-by-4 matrix full of ones using `ones`.
5. Use `reshape` to turn the array from Question 1 into a 10-by-10 matrix.
6. Given two 2-by-2 arrays A and B of your creation, do `A * B` and `dot(A, B)`. What's the difference?
7. Given the array in Question 1, set every 2nd element to 31415. (Hint: use the third parameter in list slicing)
8. Write a function that takes any arbitrary multidimensional array (aka matrix) and returns just the nth column. Hint: the function will look like `def retrieve_column(matrix, n)`.

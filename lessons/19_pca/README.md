# Objectives
Students will be able to
- Explain how principal components analysis (PCA) works
- Use PCA to better visualize the dataset
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality of the dataset, either to reduce computation time, reduce multicollinearity, or decrease model complexity.

# Programme
1. What is PCA and why/when is it useful?
2. On-board visual explanation of PCA
3. Online visual explanation of PCA
4. What is the procedure for PCA?
5. PCA Worksheet
6. Code for PCA for Visualization
7. Code for PCA for Supervised Learning
8. In-class final project time

# What is PCA
- PCA is a technique to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset.
- It transforms our feature data matrix into a matrix with fewer columns, keeping as much of the variance as possible.
- Often used for machine vision and NLP, given the high dimensionality and sometimes high correlation between background pixels (machine vision) or ngrams (NLP) for example.

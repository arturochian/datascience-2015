# What is a decision tree?
- Decision-making tool that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and consequences

# What are the pros/cons of decision trees?
- Intuitive and simple
- Translates directly to nice boolean logic (series of nested if/elses)
- Not as good as the best methods out there, but can be if we use bagging/random forests to create an ensemble of trees

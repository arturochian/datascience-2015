# Objectives
Students will be able to
- define Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- define, compute and update single-layer perceptrons
- define and compute on multi-layer perceptrons and explain why they're so powerful
- explain the pros and cons of ANNs

# Prework
- [3m intro video to Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZFvLGYa2_w)
- [5m explanation of Gradient Descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umAeJ7LMCfU)
- [4m review of this code gist](https://gist.github.com/suneel0101/801ec933307c86cdac7b) - being able to use this function to compute values of the sigmoid function given some input will be helpful for the worksheets!
- [15m review of logistic regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z2a_mzl9LM)
- [10m review of the vector dot product](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/dot_cross_products/v/vector-dot-product-and-vector-length)

# Applications of ANNs
They are the state of the art when it comes to
- machine vision
- speech recognition
- natural language processing
- stock market prediction
- self-driving cars

# Pros and Cons of ANNs
- super powerful and theoretically could learn any function
- quite hard to train, especially if we do "deep learning"
- easy to overfit or get stuck in local optima

# Objectives
Students will be able to
- Define and apply linear regression and logistic regression
- Show how and when to use these techniques
- Give practical and relevant examples from industry

# Linear Regression
## What is it?
- Given a set of data points, fine a line or curve that fits them the best.
- It is useful for modeling the relationship between N input variables (<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>N</sub>) and some output, called a target, y.

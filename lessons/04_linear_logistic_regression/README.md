# Objectives
Students will be able to
- Define and apply linear regression and logistic regression
- Show how and when to use these techniques
- Give practical and relevant examples from industry

# Linear Regression
## What is it?
- Given a set of data points, fine a line or curve that fits them the best.
- Useful for modeling the relationship between N input variables (*x*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *x*<sub>N</sub>) and *y*, some output, also called the target.

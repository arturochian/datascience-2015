# Summary
- It's been a great journey!
- We've learned a ton of different techniques and gained a pretty broad exposure to different areas of datascience.

# Next steps
To keep on progressing, here are the three areas that I would recommend:

1. Sharpen your toolkit
2. Learn the models more deeply
3. Practice a ton

# Sharpen Your Toolkit
## Advance Your Python
The better your Python skills are, the more easily you'll be able to navigate, use and where necessary customize the different libraries available to you. If none exists, you could even develop one. To this end,

1. Do as many Euler problems as possible
2. Build end-to-end apps (either Django or Flask), as this increase your awareness of how different software components can work together.
3. Read some source code, whether it's scikitlearn or something else, so you get a sense of how high-quality professional code looks like.

## Learn R
In industry, most datascientists R and RStudio for rapid exploratory analysis. It's not very difficult to learn and its main advantage is that there are so many statistical packages written for R.

[Here](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) is an effective, interactive tutorial of the language.

Once you've gotten the basics down, I would recommend going through the [R Code Labs](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) of Introduction to Statistical Learning.

## Get Comfortable Using Spark/Hadoop
As you noticed from your final project, it can take a ton of time to run analyses on your local machine serially. 

Learn about parallelizing these tasks via MapReduce. Going through the [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) tutorials is a good place to start.

## Invest in Visualization
If you can do powerful analyses and tell incredibly compelling visual stories with the data, you will be unstoppable.

It's worth it to get good at [D3](http://d3js.org/) and improve your `matplotlib` skills.

# Learn the models more deeply
To get to the next level of datascience, you should have a strong undergraduate understanding of the following:

1. Probability - check out this [phenomenal book](http://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Probability-9th-Edition/dp/032179477X) by Sheldon Ross.
2. Statistics
3. Linear Algebra - great [book](http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Edition/dp/0030105676) by Gilbert Strang. He has some online lecture videos as well.

Once you feel strong with the math, move on to [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - this is THE BIBLE of datascience. You can learn from it or just use it as reference.

# Practice a ton
Here are some tips on deliberate practice:

- Do [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/competitions) competitions
- Learn scraping [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) so you can collect your own data and get better at datawrangling
- Hack with others, especially those better than you
- Push yourself to get better at harder techniques like neural networks

# Closing
- Let's keep in touch - my email is suneel@suneelchakravorty.com
- Come to dat-alum meetups/happy hours - Daniel emailed out some info about this
- We'll have a reunion happy hour in the summer

Bon voyage!
